Agent: Sure, I'll be happy to assist you. Can you please provide me with your order number?

Customer: Yes, it's 789012.

Agent: Thank you. I see that your order was delivered on June 1st. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, that's right.

Agent: Okay, can you please tell me the reason for the return?

Customer: I ordered a medium size, but it's too small for me. So, I want to return it and get a refund.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that the size didn't fit you. Before we proceed with the return, I want to inform you that we have an applicable return fee of $5 for all returns. Is that okay with you?

Customer: Oh, I wasn't aware of that. Can you please explain it to me?

Agent: Sure. The return fee is charged to cover the cost of processing the return and restocking the item. It's deducted from the refund amount. For example, if you paid $20 for the T-Shirt, and the return fee is $5, you will receive a refund of $15.

Customer: I see. That's reasonable. So, how do I proceed with the return?

Agent: You can initiate the return request by logging into your account on our website. Once you log in, go to the ""Order History"" section, select the order containing the T-Shirt, and click on the ""Return Item"" button. Follow the prompts to complete the return request.

Customer: Okay, I'll do that. How long will it take to process the return and get the refund?

Agent: Once we receive the returned item, it takes about 3-5 business days to process the refund. You will receive an email notification once the refund is processed.

Customer: Alright, that sounds good. Thank you for your help, Sarah.
